# 🤖 Machine Learning – Complete Roadmap & Guide

## 🌱 Introduction

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a branch of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** that enables systems to **learn automatically from data and improve their performance** without being explicitly programmed.

Instead of following strict rules, ML models identify **patterns and relationships** in data and use them to make **predictions, classifications, or decisions**.

> In simple words: Machine Learning is all about teaching computers to learn from experience (data) — just like humans do.
